Hi everyone!! 

This repository contains my work for Task 1 â€” Web Scraping as part of my "Data Analytics Internship with CodeAlpha".  

For this project, I used "Python (Requests + BeautifulSoup)" to scrape quotes (text, authors, and tags) from the practice website [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com). The scraped data is then saved into a CSV file and analyzed using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook.  


Files in this repository:

- `CodeAlpha_WebScrape_DivyaDarshini.ipynb` - My notebook with the scraping code and analysis.  
- `quotes_toscarp.csv` - The dataset created after scraping.  

How to run this project:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab (or Jupyter).  
2. Install the required packages if they are not already available:
   !pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas
3. Run all the cells in order.
4. A CSV file will be generated with quotes, authors, and tags.
